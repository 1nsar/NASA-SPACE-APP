# NASA-SPACE-APP
In 2021, the 10th annual NASA Space Apps Challenge event took place. Dubbed the “largest annual global hackathon in the world,” the goal of the Space Apps Challenge is for teams to create open-source solutions to address challenges on Earth and in space around a specific theme over a collaborative weekend.
With our team we took the "MEASURING THE VALUE OF EARTH OBSERVATIONS" problem. According to the problem, our solution helps to describe how Earth observations affect a specific decision that leads to improved outcomes for society.That's why we documented NASA missions, their descriptions, data and resources, and created a visually readable website.
